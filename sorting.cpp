Insertion Sort

Sorting is the process of arranging a list of elements in a particular order (Ascending or Descending).

Insertion sort algorithm arranges a list of elements in a particular order. In insertion sort algorithm, every iteration moves an element from unsorted portion to sorted portion until all the elements are sorted in the list.

Step by Step Process

The insertion sort algorithm is performed using following steps...

Step 1: Asume that first element in the list is in sorted portion of the list and remaining all elements are in unsorted portion.
Step 2: Consider first element from the unsorted list and insert that element into the sorted list in order specified.
Step 3: Repeat the above process until all the elements from the unsorted list are moved into the sorted list.
